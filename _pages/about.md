About
======
**I will join Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) starting from January 2024. I am looking for Master/PhD/Postdoc. If you are interested, please send me an email (zhongqir@andrew.cmu.edu).**

I am a postdoc with [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) (CMU, the U.S.).
I received my Ph.D. degree from the same lab, advised by Professor [Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/) and Professor [Maxim Likhachev](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/).
I received my Master degree from Carnegie Mellon University and B.Eng. from both [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) (China) and [FH Aachen](https://www.fh-aachen.de/en/) (Germany).
Prior to my Ph.D., I was a co-founder and the CTO of [BITO Robotics](https://bitorobotics.com/en/).

I am broadly interested in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. My research focuses on solving fundamental path and motion planning problems for single and multiple robots, by leveraging and advancing the frontier of multi-agent planning, combinatorial search and optimal control. These problems are often NP-hard, and my research exploits the underlying structure of these problems to develop algorithms that balance between runtime efficiency and solution quality guarantees, while being deployable to physical robots. These problems often arise in warehouse logistics, manufacturing and search-and-rescue. [Find More.](https://wonderren.github.io/research)
